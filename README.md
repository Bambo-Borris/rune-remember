# Rune Remember

## Uhh... What is it?
A learning aid for learning Old Norse runes in short-twig form

## How do I use it?
There are 2 modes: 
- Slow Mode - Displays runes and their names and cycles through the rune list
- Random Test Mode - Displays a rune and 3 buttons each with a different rune name, select the answer you think corresponds to the rune

## How to build it from source?
```
cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS="FALSE" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```
